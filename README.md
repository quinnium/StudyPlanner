This is a Study Planner / Revision Scheduler app for iOS.
It allows a user to enter multiple revision dates for any given subject, and displays them on a calendar.
Study subjects are color coded, and can have additional notes.

UI has been built using SwiftUI
Data persistence has been achieved using SwiftData
MVVM Achitecture 

Requires some small further improvements for better colouring in Dark Mode, and small tweaks to calendar scolling animation
